D-006 (derived soldier positions) is Accepted and implemented in
`formation.gd`. Its three binding clauses are load-bearing for
everything built so far: soldier position is a **pure function** of
(squad curve, formation shape, slot index, terrain sample) with no
per-soldier integration state; client-side cosmetic offsets are
**one-way** and never read back by simulation; casualty slot
reassignment is **deterministic** (the formation restamps — soldiers
don't walk into a vacated slot). Emergent per-soldier movement of any
kind — local avoidance, collision push-back, jostling — is out of bounds
and is the explicit revisit trigger.

`Formation` is an all-static class on purpose: there is nowhere to put
per-soldier state, so the purity clause is enforced rather than merely
documented. Cosmetic motion lives in its own file (`cosmetic_offset.gd`)
for the same reason — the one-way boundary is structural. Combat's
resolution of Q7 (D-024) satisfies this trivially rather than delicately:
`alive` is the only formation input a death changes, so casualty
reassignment needs no per-soldier identity anywhere, and `Formation`
gained no instance state to support combat.
